# The Pointless Button (Updated Version)

This is a pointless button... or is it?

In my final year of uni, I wrote this and asked my flatmates to give it a go. This was one of the first small apps I wrote in my spare time, very lightweight and originally using Flask in Python, the same framework I used for my university dissertation!

## About
This version of the app ran at the following URL: https://pointlessbutton2.herokuapp.com/

Unfortunately, I am no longer able to host the app at this address due to fact I would need to pay for resources that aren't being used.
