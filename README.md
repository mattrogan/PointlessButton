# The Pointless Button (Updated Version)

This is a pointless button... or is it?

In my final year of uni, I wrote this and asked my flatmates to give it a go. This was one of the first small apps I wrote in my spare time, very lightweight and originally using Flask in Python, the same framework I used for my university dissertation!

In late 2022, I decided to rewrite the app using React.js to make it a bit more complex, however I never got around to extending it or making it do anything more exciting. Still, the code is here if you wish to look at it or even clone it to try for yourself!

## About
This version of the app ran at the following URL: https://pointlessbutton2.herokuapp.com/

Unfortunately, I am no longer able to host the app at this address due to fact I would need to pay for resources that aren't being used.
