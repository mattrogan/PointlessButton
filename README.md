# The Pointless Button (Legacy Version)

This is a pointless button... or is it?

I wrote this one evening and asked my flatmates to give it a go. This was one of the first small apps I wrote in my spare time... very lightweight and using Flask in Python, the same framework I used for my university dissertation! I don't intent to make any extensions to the legacy code in Flask, but it's here for your perusal if you wish. 

## About
The app ran at the following URL: https://pointlessbutton1.herokuapp.com/

Unfortunately, I am no longer able to host the app at this address due to fact I would need to pay for resources that aren't being used.
