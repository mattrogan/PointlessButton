# The Pointless Button

This is a pointless button... or is it?

I wrote this one evening and asked my flatmates to give it a go. This was initially as a Flask app, using Python; the Pointless Button has since had an upgrade to use React as a front-end framework instead of Flask. All of the functionality of the app is, however, exactly the same.

## About
No hints - if you want to find out what the button does, give it a go! The app is currently running on https://pointlessbutton1.herokuapp.com/.
